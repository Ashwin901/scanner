# Scanner

This is a flutter application which uses firebase OCR technology to scan text from images

## Getting Started

When we start the application we have an opening screen where you can click a picture and if there is text in the image it is categorised into three categories phone number, url and others.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
